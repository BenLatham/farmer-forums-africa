# Farmer forums africa
A website for small scale farmers in Africa

Link: [farmerforums.africa](http://www.farmerforums.africa)


# TODO:
- Define the purpose of the site in greater detail
- Select backend and frontend technologies to use

# MVP
- A clearly defined purpose
- Several high quality pages
- A static site with a simple but atractive design, including audio 
- A clearly defined route to submit articles

# Design goals
- Works well on smartphones (mobile first)
- Uses as little data as possible (Light)
- Works well even on old phones and cheap phones
- Simple design
- Can be extended to add new features

# Purpose of the site
The aim of this site is to help anybody who grows crops or keeps animals for food or for income to produce plentifully, at the same time as looking after the people around them, the land, the air, the water, and the wild life, in a way that leaves them better tomorrow than today.

To achieve this we want to be:
- A source of reliable information.
- A website where people help and support each other.
 
# Languages
At first the website will be in English, but should aim to use simple, plain language, with audio recordings. I would like to use other languages as soon as possible. Strong contenders are French, and Swahili, to reach a wide audience.
