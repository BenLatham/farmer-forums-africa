# Farmer forums africa
A website to facilitate and support small scale farmers in Africa

# TODO:
- Define the purpose of the site in greater detail
- Select backend and frontend technologies to use

# MVP
- A clearly defined purpose
- Several high quality pages
- A static site with a simple but atractive design
- A clearly defined route to submit articles

# Design principles
- Mobile first
- Light
- Javascript for progressive enhancement only
- Clean and simple look
- extendable

# Purpose of the site
The aim of this site is to help anybody who grows crops or keeps animals for food or for income to produce plentifully, at the same time as looking after the people around them, the land, the air, the water, and the wild life, in a way that leaves them better tomorrow than today.

To achieve this we want to be:
- A source of reliable information.
- A website where people help and support each other.
 
# Languages
At first the website will be in English, but should aim to use simple, plain language. I would like to use other languages as soon as possible. I am also thinking of other ideas to make it easy to access, like using audio recordings.
